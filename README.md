# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! üöÄ

This project demonstrates my practical skills in data warehousing by following and completing a comprehensive SQL-based data warehouse build, inspired by an industry-expert led tutorial on YouTube. By engaging with this project, I gained hands-on experience in the key stages of data architecture and analytics, proving my ability to learn new concepts and apply them effectively to a real-world scenario.

## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:

1. **Bronze Layer:** Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer:** This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer:** Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
